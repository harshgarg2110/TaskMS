            <h2>Documentation and Paperwork</h2>
            <img src="./images/im1.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>
                Incomplete or inaccurate documentation can lead to delays or denials.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Completeness Matters:</strong> Ensure that all required
                documents are complete, accurate, and up-to-date.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Verification Process:</strong> Lenders often conduct a thorough
                verification process, and any inconsistencies may lead to delays.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Proof of Income:</strong> Providing clear documentation of
                stable income sources is crucial for loan approval.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Address Verification: </strong>Valid proof of residence is
                required; utility bills or government-issued documents are commonly
                accepted.

        <h2>Collateral Requirements</h2>
        <img src="./images/im2.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>
            Secured loans may require valuable assets as collateral, limiting access
            for some.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> Risk Assessment: </strong>Lenders evaluate the risk associated
            with the collateral; high-risk assets may affect loan terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Insurance:</strong> Some loans require insurance coverage for
            the collateral to protect against unforeseen events.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Asset Valuation: </strong>The value of the collateral influences
            the loan amount; accurate valuation is critical.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Ownership Documentation:</strong>Clearly demonstrate ownership
            of the collateral through proper documentation.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="difficulty">
        <h2>Loan Purpose</h2>
        <img src="./images/im3.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>
            Some banks may restrict loans based on the purpose, creating challenges
            for unconventional needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Specificity:</strong> Clearly state the purpose of the loan;
            generic requests may face more scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Business Plans:</strong>For business loans, a well-detailed
            business plan helps lenders understand the venture's viability.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Education Loans: </strong>Specify the educational institution
            and course details for educational loans.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Home Loans:</strong> Provide details about the property being
            financed, including its value and location.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensure the loan purpose aligns with
            legal and regulatory requirements.

        <h2>Lack of Banking History</h2>
        <img src="./images/im4.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>
            Individuals without a significant banking history may face challenges in
            establishing creditworthiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Stable Banking Relationships</strong> Long-term relationships
            with a bank may positively impact loan applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Co-Signers or Guarantors:</strong> Having a co-signer or
            guarantor with a strong banking history can enhance your application.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Start Small:</strong>Begin with smaller credit options to build
            a positive banking track record.

        <h2>Interest Rates</h2>
        <p>
            Lower credit scores may result in higher interest rates, making loans
            more expensive.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="difficulty">
        <h2>Credit History</h2>
        <p>
            A poor credit history or low credit score can impact loan eligibility.
